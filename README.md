# Pokémon Explorer

## About
Pokémon Explorer is one of my first full-stack projects, combining my love for Pokémon with web development. It allows users to explore, search, and create Pokémon.

## Deployment Note
This project was initially deployed on Heroku's free tier, serving as an excellent learning platform for deployment processes. However, due to changes in Heroku's pricing model, we've had to adapt our deployment strategy. This experience has been invaluable in understanding the challenges of maintaining live applications and the importance of flexible hosting solutions.
